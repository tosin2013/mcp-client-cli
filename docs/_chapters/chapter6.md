According to the [TESTING.md](https://github.com/tosin2013/mcp-client-cli/blob/main/TESTING.md) documentation, comprehensive test suites are organized into a hierarchical structure:

```
test-suites/
├── basic/
│   ├── connectivity.json
│   ├── discovery.json
│   └── simple-tools.json
├── functional/
│   ├── all-tools.json
│   ├── workflows.json
│   └── error-handling.json
├── security/
│   ├── authentication.json
│   ├── authorization.json
│   └── input-validation.json
└── performance/
    ├── response-time.json
    ├── concurrency.json
    └── resource-usage.json
```

This organization allows for modular test composition, where suites can be combined and customized to match specific testing needs.

from mcp_client_cli.testing import TestCase, TestResult, TestStatus

class DataValidationTest(TestCase):
    """Test data validation in the MCP server."""
    
    def __init__(self, config=None):
        super().__init__(config)
        self.name = "data_validation_test"
        self.description = "Validates data handling in MCP server"
        self.category = "functional"
    
    async def setup(self):
        """Prepare for test execution."""
        # Setup code here
        pass
    
    async def execute(self):
        """Execute the test."""
        # Test implementation
        client = await self.get_client()
        
        # Test valid data
        valid_result = await client.execute_tool("data_process", {
            "data": {"id": 123, "name": "Test Data"}
        })
        
        # Test invalid data
        invalid_result = await client.execute_tool("data_process", {
            "data": {"id": "not_a_number", "name": 12345}
        })
        
        # Validate results
        if valid_result.get("status") == "success" and invalid_result.get("status") == "error":
            return TestResult(
                status=TestStatus.PASSED,
                message="Data validation working correctly",
                confidence=95
            )
        else:
            return TestResult(
                status=TestStatus.FAILED,
                message="Data validation issues detected",

        """Clean up after test execution."""
        # Cleanup code here
        pass
```

This structure includes setup, execution, and cleanup phases, along with result reporting.

### Registering Custom Tests

Custom tests must be registered with the testing framework:

```python
# custom_tests/__init__.py
from mcp_client_cli.testing import register_test
from .data_validation_test import DataValidationTest

def register_custom_tests():
    register_test("data_validation", DataValidationTest)
```

Once registered, custom tests can be included in test suites or run directly:

```bash
# Run a custom test
mcp-test custom --server-name your-server --test-name data_validation

# Include in a test suite
mcp-test run-suite --server-name your-server --suite-file custom-suite.json
```

### Custom Test Configuration

Custom tests can be configured through the standard configuration system:

```json
{
  "custom_tests": {
    "data_validation": {
      "enabled": true,
      "parameters": {
        "validation_level": "strict",
        "test_data_file": "test-data/validation-samples.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration is passed to the test constructor and can be accessed during test execution.

from mcp_client_cli.testing.utils import (
    compare_results,
    generate_test_data,
    validate_schema,
    measure_performance,
    capture_logs
)

# Compare actual results with expected results
comparison = compare_results(actual_result, expected_result)

# Generate test data based on schema
test_data = generate_test_data(schema, count=10)

# Validate data against schema
validation_result = validate_schema(data, schema)

# Measure performance metrics
performance = measure_performance(lambda: client.execute_tool("example"))

# Capture logs during test execution
with capture_logs() as logs:
    result = client.execute_tool("example")
    log_entries = logs.get_entries()
